/*: question1
 ### 1. What is the type of the variable `pet` declared below?
 */
var pet = "turtle üê¢"
// variable is a string
/*: question2
 ### 2. What is the type of the variable `petName` declared below?
 */
var petName: String?
// variable is an optional string
/*: question3
 ### 3. Currently, what is the _value_ of `petName`?
 */
// nil
/*: question4
 ### 4. Give `petName` a value! Assign to it any string. What is its type now?
 */
petName = "Maxwell"
// it is still an optional string
/*: question5
 ### 5. Print out `petName` using Swift's `print()` function. What do you expect to see in the console?
 */
print(petName)
// I expected to see what I saw; the word "Optional" with the value I assigned to it.
/*: question6
 ### 6. Write an if statement that only prints `petName`'s value if it is not `nil`. If `petName` is `nil`, print, "There is no pet name." What do you expect to see in the console?
 */
if petName != nil {
    print(petName)
} else {
    print("There is no pet name")
}
/*: question7
 ### 7. Use _optional binding_ to unwrap the value of `petName` and print it to the console without all the **Optional(...)** stuff around it.
 */
if let petName = petName {
    print(petName)
} else {
    print("There is no pet name")
}
/*: question8
 ### 8. Write an if statement that will print out "The value of anotherPetName is nil" using the variable below
 */
var anotherPetName: String?
print("The value of anotherPetName is \(anotherPetName)")
// I'm not sure why I need an if statement here
/*: question9
 ### 9. Using optional binding, write an if statement that prints "anotherPetName has no value" if it is `nil`; otherwise, print the _unwrapped_ value of `anotherPetName`. What do you expect to see in the console?
 */
if let anotherPetName = anotherPetName {
    print("the unwrapped value of anotherPetName is \(anotherPetName)")
} else {
    print("anotherPetName has no value")
}
/*: question10
 ### 10. Declare a _constant_ optional string (using the `let` keyword). Then try to assign a string value to it on the next line. Print out the constant. What happens?
 */
let optionalConstant : String?
//let optionalConstant = "Maxwell"
//you can only assing a value to a constant when it is declared therefore I expected an error and that's what I got.
/*: question11
 ### 11. Declare another _constant_ optional string, and set it to `nil` immediately. Then, on the next line, assign a string value to it. What happens?
 */
let optionalConstant2 : String? = nil
//optionalConstant2 = "Whatever"
//still getting an error cause it's still a constant
